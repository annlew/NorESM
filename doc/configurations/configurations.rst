Some of the input data, the look-up tables (LUT) for NorESM specific aerosol optics and size information for calculation of cloud droplet activation, can be modified either for testing purposes or in order to take into account new developments in the aerosol microphysics scheme. Some typical examples of input that may need to be updated are: refractive indices; assumed (log-normal) size parameters at the point of emission or production; assumed hygroscopicities for sub-saturated conditions. Such changes can be made in the offline "sectional" aerosol module AeroTab (as in the example of new refractive indices), or both in AeroTab and in the online aerosol module OsloAero in the CAM6-Nor code (as in the example of assumed size parameters). Many aerosol related model changes may be done without having to touch the AeroTab code and thee LUT at all, such as e.g. the emissions (whether they are prescribed or interactive).  

A user guide for the AeroTab code, as well as the corresponding CAM6-Nor (OsloAero) code which is using the AeroTab LUT, will soon be available here. Until then, this AeroTab presentation (https://github.com/Kirkevag/NorESM/blob/noresm2/doc/configurations/AeroTab-slides-updateJan2020.pdf) can be used as a first introduction. For questions about AeroTab, contakt Alf Kirkevåg (alfk at met.no) or Øyvind Seland (oyvinds at met.no).

.. _noresm2_output:

Atmospheric output for some commonly used configurations of NorESM2
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

In preparation for CMIP6 and the required model output for the various 
MIPs, NorESM2 has been set up with different configurations, all run as 
AMIP using the compset NF2000climo (on 2 degrees) in noresm-dev (2.0: 
commit 7757f2d8258d5f84e960db12f840afebc69d7856 from October 30'th 2018; 
(2.1: COMMIT 35b90aab78c2cceee636539894c9ff9015355f2f from March 25'th 
2019) The given estimates in CPU-time increase are based on 1 month 
simulations, including model initialization, and are therefore low end 
estimates. 

With standard set-up of the model, the monthly output variables (1, 2
and 3 D) are:

:ref:`standard_output`

Adding history_aerosol = .true. to user_nl_cam gives the following
additional 577 variables (+ ca. 13 % CPU-time)

:ref:`history_aerosol_extra_output`

Furthermore including #define AEROFFL to preprocessorDefinitions.h gives
8 additionally variables (+ ca. 5% CPU-time)

:ref:`aeroffl_extra_output`

and when also #define AEROCOM is activated there, we additionally get
the following 149 variables (+ ca. 13% CPU-time)

:ref:`aerocom_extra_output`

Finally, also taking out COSP data (./xmlchange --append
CAM_CONFIG_OPTS='-cosp'), the following 57 output variables (of which 7
are 4 D) are added to the output (+ ca. 10% CPU-time):

:ref:`cosp_extra_output`
